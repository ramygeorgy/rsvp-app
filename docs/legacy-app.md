Overview
========

The legacy app is used once a year to manage and track attendees to a company Christmas party. It has the following components:

1. A standalone importer that processes a CSV file and populates the database
2. A simple public-facing web application to which invited guests are directed to submit their RSVP
3. A back-office javascript client application that tracks RSVPs (for event planning purposes)


The following sections describe each of the above components in more detail.
